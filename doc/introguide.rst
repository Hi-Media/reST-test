About This Guide
========================

Purpose
-------

This document is designed to provide you details on how to integrate your business to 
the HiPay TPP payment gateway. This document provides step-by-step instructions on how 
to simply and quickly get up and running with our services as well as detailed reference material.
Where applicable, this document refers to the related documentation with further details.

Intended Audience
-----------------

The intended audience is the merchant's technical staff or the merchant's system integrator.
Because almost all communication between the merchant's system and the REST API is realized
through predefined XML or JSON messages over the Internet using standard protocols,
you will need basic XML/JSON programming skills and knowledge of HTTP(S).
Furthermore, it is recommended that you are familiar with the basics of tokenization concepts.
